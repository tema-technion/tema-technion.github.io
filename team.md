### About

In smart, data-intensive, and technologically advanced transportation systems, the main challenge remains a better representation of human choice processes, behavioral patterns, and technology–human interfaces. My work addresses this from a decision-systems perspective: I study how real people make mobility decisions—with bounded attention, spatial memory, emotions, and habits — and how those decisions are encoded in models, data systems, and AI tools. Substantively, my research spans route and mode choice, transfers and hubs, safety and risk, adoption of vehicle and information technologies, and decision-support and policy processes. The overarching aim is to align models and DSS with human behavior and experience so that policies can support voluntary change, safer systems, and greener everyday travel.

### Working with me in TEMA

Students in TEMA typically work at the interface of behavior, data, and decision-support: combining behavioral theory with econometric, statistical/ machine-learning models, spatial analysis, and field data, and engaging with agencies or operators on real planning, safety, and policy questions. Projects are framed by our decision loop—decision rules, outcomes in networks and services, and institutional/AI learning from partial logs—rather than by a fixed mode or technology.

### Background and supervision

Before joining the Technion, I was a faculty member at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. I have held visiting positions as an Eleonore Trefftz guest professor at TU Dresden and as an AIANI Fellow at the University of Innsbruck, and I am an external collaborator with the TRANSyT Transportation Research Center at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid. I have supervised more than 30 graduate students from around 15 countries; alumni now hold academic and research positions and work in ministries, transport agencies, and mobility- and data-oriented companies.

### Field roles

I serve on the editorial boards of Transportation, Transportation Research Part D, and in international evaluation activities such as ERC review panels and large European research programs. I collaborate with Israel’s Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), the National Road Safety Authority, Ayalon Highways and the Trans-Israel Planning Division, anchoring the lab at the interface of decision-systems research and practice.
