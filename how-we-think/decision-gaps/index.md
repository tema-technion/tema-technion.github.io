## Decision Gaps in an AI-Rich Mobility World

### Human–system gaps

Routing apps, platforms, DSS, and AI systems embody specific decision logics and objectives — efficiency, safety, environmental performance — that do not always align with how travelers perceive and experience the system.

We study situations where models and indicators declare a link, hub, or scheme successful, while observed behavior and reported experience reveal avoidance, perceived unsafety, confusion, or exclusion.

These human–system gaps motivate our work on aligning system logic with bounded human decision processes and lived experience.

### Data-driven behavioral insight

Contemporary mobility systems are monitored through heterogeneous and often partial data streams: crashes, near-misses, complaints, operational logs, GPS/app traces, disruption records, and sometimes synthetic data.

We examine the behavioral content and sampling biases of these traces — who and what they omit — and how they can be combined to reveal patterns, blind spots, and inequities that traditional KPIs and model outputs miss.

A central concern is what AI and DSS fail to learn because of under-reporting, selection effects, and non-use — and how to design learning processes that are aware of these omissions.

### Human–machine decision interaction

In AI-mediated environments, humans and decision aids form coupled decision systems.

Travelers respond to recommendations, warnings, credits, missions, and defaults with trust calibration, skepticism, workarounds, and habit. At the same time, they feed information back into systems through usage, overrides, complaints, and participation in co-production and crowdsourcing tools.

We study how these interaction patterns evolve, how collaboration modes (delegation, consultation, constraint-setting) affect outcomes, and what this implies for the design of decision rules and learning processes in mobility DSS and AI.

## How this perspective is applied

We apply this decision-systems perspective across smart mobility, public transport, active travel, safety, and sustainable development using data-driven, spatial, behavioral, and human–machine interaction approaches.

Our goal is to build models and tools that are behaviorally realistic and policy-relevant — supporting voluntary change, safer and greener mobility, and more transparent, adaptive decision support for agencies and operators.
