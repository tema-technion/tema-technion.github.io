# How we think

At TEMA we study how real people make mobility decisions, how systems and AI represent those decisions, and where the two align.

Travelers operate with bounded motivations and decision rules.  
Their choices generate outcomes in networks and services.  
Institutions and AI tools sense and diagnose these outcomes through partial data.  
Together, humans and systems co-produce and govern future mobility.

## Human in the Loop

### Cognitive and perceptual mechanisms

We examine how attention, perception, memory, and bounded rationality shape travel decisions. Rather than assuming full information and compensatory optimization, we focus on consideration sets, screening rules, heuristics, regret, and loss-avoidance, and on how risk, trust, social norms, and service climate enter the internal decision protocol.

This perspective underlies our work on mode and route choice, technology adoption, safety-related behavior, and responses to information and incentives.

### Spatial behavior and context

We link movement patterns to spatial cognition and urban context: which routes, places, and hubs are perceived, encoded, and reused — and which remain invisible, confusing, or systematically avoided.

We examine how network structure, urban form, landmarks, greenery, and perceived safety interact with route and mode choice, transfer behavior, and activity patterns. A central question is how models can reflect the spatial representations and collective memories of travelers.

### Emotional and experiential dimensions

We treat needs, emotions, and subjective experience as structured components of behavior.

Perceived safety and risk, stress and cognitive load, comfort, fairness, trust in operators and institutions, and service climate shape willingness to use public transport, to walk or cycle, to adopt in-vehicle safety systems, and to comply with guidance.

A recurring challenge is how to represent these experiential dimensions in models and indicators in ways that remain empirically grounded and compatible with policy analysis.
