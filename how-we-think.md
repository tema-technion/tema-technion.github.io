# How we think

We study how real people make mobility decisions, how systems and AI represent those decisions, and where the two are misaligned.

---

## The Decision Loop

At TEMA we conceptualize mobility as a decision loop between humans, systems, and algorithms.

Travelers operate with bounded motivations and decision rules.  
Their choices generate outcomes in networks and services.  
Institutions and AI tools sense and diagnose these outcomes through partial data.  
Together, humans and systems co-produce and govern future mobility.

## Human in the Loop

### Cognitive and perceptual mechanisms

We examine how attention, perception, memory, and bounded rationality shape travel decisions. Rather than assuming full information and compensatory optimization, we focus on consideration sets, screening rules, heuristics, regret, and loss-avoidance, and on how risk, trust, social norms, and service climate enter the internal decision protocol.

This perspective underlies our work on mode and route choice, technology adoption, safety-related behavior, and responses to information and incentives.

### Spatial behavior and context

We link movement patterns to spatial cognition and urban context: which routes, places, and hubs are perceived, encoded, and reused — and which remain invisible, confusing, or systematically avoided.

We examine how network structure, urban form, landmarks, greenery, and perceived safety interact with route and mode choice, transfer behavior, and activity patterns. A central question is how models can reflect the spatial representations and collective memories of travelers.

---

### Emotional and experiential dimensions

We treat needs, emotions, and subjective experience as structured components of behavior.

Perceived safety and risk, stress and cognitive load, comfort, fairness, trust in operators and institutions, and service climate shape willingness to use public transport, to walk or cycle, to adopt in-vehicle safety systems, and to comply with guidance.

A recurring challenge is how to represent these experiential dimensions in models and indicators in ways that remain empirically grounded and compatible with policy analysis.

## Decision Gaps in an AI-Rich Mobility World

### Human–system gaps

Routing apps, platforms, DSS, and AI systems embody specific decision logics and objectives — efficiency, safety, environmental performance — that do not always align with how travelers perceive and experience the system.

We study situations where models and indicators declare a link, hub, or scheme successful, while observed behavior and reported experience reveal avoidance, perceived unsafety, confusion, or exclusion.

These human–system gaps motivate our work on aligning system logic with bounded human decision processes and lived experience.

### Data-driven behavioral insight

Contemporary mobility systems are monitored through heterogeneous and often partial data streams: crashes, near-misses, complaints, operational logs, GPS/app traces, disruption records, and sometimes synthetic data.

We examine the behavioral content and sampling biases of these traces — who and what they omit — and how they can be combined to reveal patterns, blind spots, and inequities that traditional KPIs and model outputs miss.

A central concern is what AI and DSS fail to learn because of under-reporting, selection effects, and non-use — and how to design learning processes that are aware of these omissions.

---

### Human–machine decision interaction

In AI-mediated environments, humans and decision aids form coupled decision systems.

Travelers respond to recommendations, warnings, credits, missions, and defaults with trust calibration, skepticism, workarounds, and habit. At the same time, they feed information back into systems through usage, overrides, complaints, and participation in co-production and crowdsourcing tools.

We study how these interaction patterns evolve, how collaboration modes (delegation, consultation, constraint-setting) affect outcomes, and what this implies for the design of decision rules and learning processes in mobility DSS and AI.

---

## How this perspective is applied

We apply this decision-systems perspective across smart mobility, public transport, active travel, safety, and sustainable development using data-driven, spatial, behavioral, and human–machine interaction approaches.

Our goal is to build models and tools that are behaviorally realistic and policy-relevant — supporting voluntary change, safer and greener mobility, and more transparent, adaptive decision support for agencies and operators.
