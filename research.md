  <h1>What do we study?</h1>

  <p class="research-intro">
    At TEMA we study how people move through cities, how systems respond,
    and how data and models can help redesign mobility. Our work spans
    active and green mobility, digital mobility and vehicle technology,
    public transport and transfers, safety and risk, and decision-support for policy.
  </p>

  <div class="research-theme">
    <h2>Green and active mobility</h2>
    <p>
      Walking, cycling, and micromobility as mode and route choices. We study what
      motivates green mobility mode, route, and distance decisions; how socio-ecological
      environments—urban form, street design and safety, cycling culture, and road-user
      interactions—shape active and low-carbon travel; and how campaigns, gamification,
      and shared bike / e-bike schemes can support sustained shifts in behavior.
    </p>

  <div class="research-theme">
    <h2>Digital mobility and vehicle technology</h2>
    <p>
      We model intentions and adoption of EV/HEV, ADAS, multimodal apps and MaaS,
      use data analytics to study EV and ADAS uptake and use, examine the effects
      of charging arrangements, and study human–machine interaction and responses
      to smart-charging contracts and gamification for value-based travel choice.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-theme">
    <h2>Public transport and transfer experience</h2>
    <p>
      We investigate public transport use and service climate, passenger satisfaction,
      safety and equity, and responses to disruptions. Using surveys, operational and
      GIS data, we build service indicators, map service problems, and model transfer
      experience with discrete choice, MCDA and microsimulation.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-theme">
    <h2>Safety, risk, and resilience</h2>
    <p>
      We model crash occurrence and injury severity across modes, evaluate Safe Systems
      infrastructure, and study safety perceptions and interactions between drivers,
      cyclists, pedestrians and micromobility users.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-theme">
    <h2>Policy design and decision support</h2>
    <p>
      We develop tools connecting behavioral models with planning and policy,
      design bounded-rational scenario processes, apply MCDA, and analyze
      policy lock-ins in safety and infrastructure.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="research-theme">
    <h2>Data-driven and smart-systems methods</h2>
    <p>
      Across topics, we use large-scale analytics, complaint mining,
      smart-system logs and spatial point-process models for safety and
      Vision Zero–oriented analysis.
